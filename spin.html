        You may have heard of people doing Spinning Classes or Spin Classes and wondered what exactly it means. First of all, since “Spinning” refers specifically to the company, Spinning classes mean classes put on or licensed by Mad Dogg Athletics, the company that created the Spinning program.
You can definitely get a great workout at home on a Spin bike of your own (check here for the best Spin Bikes for home), but it’s also great to workout in a class environment where there is a sense of team effort and group motivation. When you’re by yourself it’s hard to truly push yourself as you’re the only one there to keep you accountable. But if you’re in a class then you have the other participants, as well as the teacher, constantly watching over you which will give you more drive. For anyone looking in on a class it almost looks torturous: loud music blaring through the speakers, an assertive class leader shouting at people to go harder and a group of people sweating buckets from every part of their body. However, once you start you’ll never go back.  So let’s get specific about what you can expect from a Spinning Class.
