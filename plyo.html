                    A plyometric box, also simply known as a plyo or jump box, is a piece of training equipment used for
plyometric exercises. Plyometric exercises are a type of explosive power training that uses muscle
elasticity to produce rapid, forceful movements.The plyometric box provides a stable platform
for performing plyometric exercises such as box jumps, box squats, and box step-ups.<br><br>

Plyometric boxes are used by athletes and trainers to improve explosive power, speed, and
agility.They are also used by physical therapists to help patients rehabilitation from injury.<br><br>

<h3>Design</h3>
Plyometric boxes are typically made of wood, metal, or plastic, and come in a variety of sizes. The
size of the box is determined by the height of the user and the desired level of difficulty for the
exercise. For example, a taller person may need a taller box for a box jump, while a smaller person
may need a smaller box for a box step-up. The box is typically a rectangular box with 50 x 60 x 75
cm (20 x 24 x 30 inch) sides.
