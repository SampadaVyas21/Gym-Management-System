                    <h2>Steam Room</h2>
                    A steam room (sometimes called a Turkish-style bath) provides moist heat. These rooms are usually
                    tiled (or sometimes another non-porous material like glass or plastic is used) and are airtight to
                    trap all of the moisture that is created by a steam generator. When you enter a steam room, you'll
                    immediately notice steam both on your skin (making it will feel damp) and in the air (which often
                    feels thick).

                    Steam rooms are designed to accommodate 95% to 100% humidity. The temperature in a steam room may
                    range from 100 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit, but it may feel warmer because of the high humidity. In
                    some steam rooms, you'll find a spray bottle of eucalyptus oil or another scent to enhance your
                    steam experience.Because steam rises, you'll find that sitting higher in a steam room provides more
                    intense heat and steam while sitting lower in a steam room offers less steam and heat.

                    <h2>Sauna Room</h2>
                    A traditional sauna provides dry heat. Depending on the sauna you use, you might experience moisture
                    as low as 10% or as high as 60%. The amount of moisture you experience is often dependent on the
                    sauna style you choose. Some saunas allow you to increase the humidity by pouring water on hot rocks
                    to create steam.

                    <h4>Different Types</h4>
                    According to the North American Sauna Society, a sauna is a room heated to 150 to 195 degrees, with
                    humidity ranging from around 10% to 60%. There are many types of saunas, the most common of which
                    are detailed below.

                    Smoke saunas utilize a wood-burning stove to heat rocks in a room without a chimney. After the
                    heating process is complete, the room is ventilated before you enter it.
                    Wood-burning saunas use rocks or wood to produce heat and is closest to the traditional Finnish
                    sauna. You can modify the amount of heat in the room by adjusting the rate of burn.
